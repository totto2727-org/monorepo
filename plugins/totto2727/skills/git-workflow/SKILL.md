# Git Workflow

This is a unified git workflow skill that combines commit rules, operations rules, file deletion rules, and branch-split workflows into a single reference. It MUST ALWAYS be applied when performing any git operations.

## Decision Flow

When performing git operations, determine which reference applies:

### "I need to create a commit"

Follow [references/commit-rules.md](references/commit-rules.md):

- Analyze changes with `git status`, `git diff`, `git diff --staged`
- Detect commit message language from `git log --oneline -10`
- Group related changes into granular commits
- Use Conventional Commits format: `type(scope): description`
- GPG signing is required (see below)

### "I need to stage, unstage, undo, or stash"

Follow [references/operations-rules.md](references/operations-rules.md):

- Use `git unstage` (no options) to reset staging area
- Use `git undo` (no options) to undo the last commit
- Use `git stash push` (not shorthand `git stash`) to save changes
- Use `git stash apply` (not `git stash pop`) to restore
- Do not use `git -C <path>`

### "I need to delete files"

Follow [references/file-deletion-rules.md](references/file-deletion-rules.md):

- NEVER use `rm` or `unlink` directly
- ALWAYS stash files before deletion to preserve them
- For tracked files: `git stash push` then `git rm`
- For untracked files: `git add` then `git stash push`
- Before performing destructive file operations, confirm the target files with the user if the scope is large (>5 files)

### "I need to split work into multiple branches and PRs"

Follow [references/branch-split-workflow.md](references/branch-split-workflow.md) and use [assets/plan-template.md](assets/plan-template.md):

- Create a plan analyzing file dependencies
- Execute per-branch workflow: stage all, stash, switch, apply, unstage, selective add, commit
- Push and create PRs for each branch
- Present PR URL list when complete

## Universal Rules

These rules apply to ALL git operations without exception. Details are in the reference files above.

- **GPG signing required** — never use `--no-gpg-sign`; on error, halt and report (see [commit-rules.md](references/commit-rules.md))
- **`git reset` is prohibited** — use `git unstage` or `git undo` instead (see [operations-rules.md](references/operations-rules.md))
- **No direct file deletion** — always stash before deleting (see [file-deletion-rules.md](references/file-deletion-rules.md))
- **One command at a time** — no `&&` chaining; pipes and `$(...)` within a single command are allowed (see [operations-rules.md](references/operations-rules.md))
- **Error handling** — on conflicts, push failures, or git errors: halt, report current state, and request instructions
