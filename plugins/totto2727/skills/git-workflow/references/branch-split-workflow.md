# Branch Split and PR Workflow

A workflow for splitting changes into multiple branches and submitting PRs for each. The plan must strictly follow the [plan-template.md](../assets/plan-template.md) included in this skill.

## Referenced Rules

- **Commit messages & granularity**: Follow [commit-rules.md](commit-rules.md)
- **Stash / unstage**: Follow [operations-rules.md](operations-rules.md)

## Phase 1: Create and Review the Plan

1. Analyze changed files and their dependencies
2. Apply rules:
   - New additions (tests or target units) get separate branches
   - Existing modifications are included in the related new PR (but as separate commits)
3. Document the following in the plan:
   - File dependency table (group, type: new/existing modification)
   - List of branches to create (branch name, new/existing modification, dependencies)
   - "Preparation" and "Commit" steps for each branch (file paths and commit messages)
   - Excluded files list
   - Note that work should be halted and instructions requested on error

Edit the plan template from [plan-template.md](../assets/plan-template.md) to match the project's changes.

## Phase 2: Execute Per Branch (Strictly Follow)

Follow this order strictly for each branch. **On conflicts or errors, halt immediately, report the state, and request instructions.**

### Common Workflow (Per Branch)

```bash
# 1. Stage all changes (required to include untracked files)
git add .

# 2. Stash (with a message identifying the work)
git stash push -m "wip: changes for <branch-name>"

# 3. Switch to base branch & create new branch
git switch -f <base-branch>
git switch -c <branch-name>

# 4. Restore stash
git stash apply stash@{0}

# 5. Unstage all
git unstage

# 6. Add only the relevant files per the plan and commit
git add <file1> <file2> ...
git commit -m "<commit-message>"
```

- Use `git switch` instead of `git checkout`
- Stash messages should clearly identify the work unit, e.g., `wip: changes for <branch-name>`
- Restore using `git stash apply stash@{0}` to explicitly target the latest stash
- Commits must follow Conventional Commits and granularity rules from [commit-rules.md](commit-rules.md)

### Notes

- Deleted files must also be staged with `git add <deleted-file-path>`
- Do not include files listed as "excluded" in the plan

## Phase 3: Push and Create PRs

For each branch:

1. `git push -u origin <branch-name>`
2. `gh pr create --base <base-branch> --title "<title>" --body "<body>" --assignee @me` (use the repository's default branch or the branch specified in the plan)

PR body should follow the repository's PR template. Title should be a concise description of the changes.

## Phase 4: Present PR URL List

After all PRs are created, present the following markdown format to the user (clickable links):

```markdown
## Created PRs

- [PR #<number> - <branch-name>](PR-URL)
- [PR #<number> - <branch-name>](PR-URL)
  ...
```

## On Error

- If conflicts, push failures, or gh errors occur, halt work
- Report the current branch, stash status, and error message
- Do not attempt to resolve on your own

## Plan Template

See [plan-template.md](../assets/plan-template.md) for the detailed template and step examples. Structure includes:

- Overview & rules (separate branches for new items, include existing modifications in related PRs, halt on error)
- File dependency table (group, target files, dependent mocks, type)
- Branch list table (#, branch name, new/existing modification, dependencies)
- Git workflow (common workflow code block)
- "Preparation" and "Commit" steps for each branch (command examples)
- Excluded files & error handling
