# GitHub Infrastructure

This guide is for maintainers who configure GitHub App authentication and deploy repository settings with Pulumi.

## Prerequisites

- Install the Pulumi CLI and run `pulumi login`.
- Use Pulumi organization `totto2727` and stack `production`.
- Have permission to register and install a GitHub App in each managed GitHub organization.
- Run commands from the repository root.

## 1. Create a GitHub App

Open [Register new GitHub App](https://github.com/organizations/totto2727-org/settings/apps/new) in `totto2727-org`.
Use these settings:

| Setting                                        | Value                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| GitHub App name                                | A unique name of your choice                |
| Homepage URL                                   | `https://github.com/totto2727-org/monorepo` |
| Callback URL                                   | Leave empty                                 |
| Request user authorization during installation | Disabled                                    |
| Device Flow                                    | Disabled                                    |
| Webhook: Active                                | Disabled                                    |
| Where can this GitHub App be installed?        | **Any account**                             |

Select **Any account** so that you can install the same App in other organizations later.
This setting does not grant access to those organizations.
An administrator must install the App in each organization.

Set these **Repository permissions**:

| Permission     | Level          |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| Administration | Read and write |
| Contents       | Read and write |
| Metadata       | Read-only      |

Do not add organization or account permissions.
This configuration uses installation tokens, not user OAuth authorization.

After you create the App:

1. Record its **App ID** from the App settings page. Do not use the Client ID.
2. Select **Generate a private key** and download the PEM file.
3. Open **Install App** and select `totto2727-org`.
4. Select **Only select repositories** and grant access to every repository in [`src/totto2727-org.ts`](./src/totto2727-org.ts).
5. Complete the installation. App registration alone does not install the App.

You can select **All repositories** instead if the App must access current and future repositories in that organization.
With **Only select repositories**, update the installation access before you add another repository to Pulumi.

## 2. Configure Pulumi ESC

In Pulumi Console, select organization `totto2727`.
Create ESC project `github` and environment `production`.
The full environment name is `totto2727/github/production`.
The stack configuration in `Pulumi.production.yaml` already references `github/production`.

Paste this definition into the ESC environment:

```yaml
values:
  githubApp:
    appId: 123456
    privateKey:
      fn::secret: |
        -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
        REPLACE_WITH_PRIVATE_KEY
        -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
  tokens:
    totto2727Org:
      fn::open::gh-login:
        appId: ${githubApp.appId}
        privateKey: ${githubApp.privateKey}
        owner: totto2727-org
        permissions:
          administration: write
          contents: write
          metadata: read
  pulumiConfig:
    githubOwners:totto2727OrgToken: ${tokens.totto2727Org.accessToken}
```

Replace `123456` with the numeric App ID.
Replace the private key block with the complete PEM file, including its BEGIN and END lines.
Keep the `fn::secret` wrapper and YAML indentation.
Save the environment without copying the private key into source control or chat.

ESC uses `gh-login` to issue an installation token with a one-hour lifetime.
Pulumi reads the token through secret configuration `githubOwners:totto2727OrgToken` and passes it to the `totto2727-org` Provider.
A PAT and a shared `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable are not required.
The App private key remains a long-lived credential. Revoke and replace it when needed.

## 3. Verify and deploy

Run `just --justfile infra/Justfile github-preview` to check authentication and the proposed changes.
For a preview that refreshes remote state and shows detailed differences, run:

```bash
pulumi preview --cwd infra/github --stack production --refresh --diff
```

If ESC reports `the GitHub App is not installed for owner`, check the installation target and App ID.
If a repository is inaccessible, check the installation repository selection and App permissions.
Do not apply changes until authentication succeeds and you have reviewed the preview.

After approval, apply the reviewed changes:

```bash
just --justfile infra/Justfile github-up
```

## Add a repository

Add an individual `createRepository(...)` call to the module for its owner.
The factory applies the shared merge policy, branch rules, secret scanning, push protection, and vulnerability alerts.
Projects and Wiki are disabled. Preserve an existing Issues setting when you import a repository.
Use repository-specific settings only for real differences such as its description, source, template status, and CI names.

For a new repository, Pulumi can create it directly:

```ts
export const example = createRepository('example', {
  autoInit: true,
  description: 'Describe the purpose of this repository',
})
```

For a new fork, specify its source:

```ts
export const exampleFork = createRepository('example-fork', {
  description: 'Describe the purpose of this fork',
  fork: 'true',
  sourceOwner: 'upstream-owner',
  sourceRepo: 'upstream-repository',
})
```

For a repository generated from a template, specify `template`:

```ts
export const exampleFromTemplate = createRepository('example-from-template', {
  description: 'Describe the purpose of this repository',
  template: {
    includeAllBranches: false,
    owner: 'totto2727-org',
    repository: 'template-moonbit-simple',
  },
})
```

Set `isTemplate: true` only when the resulting repository must itself be available as a template.
The `template` setting selects a source. It does not mark the resulting repository as a template.
The third factory argument selects required CI contexts and defaults to `['check']`.
Use the actual workflow check names. Use `[]` only when the repository has no applicable CI check.

For an existing repository, import it before you apply the declaration.
Its Pulumi logical name is `repository-<owner>-<name>` and its import ID is the existing repository name.
Use credentials for the same owner.
Keep existing fork and template source values in its declaration.
Do not change creation-only source values on an existing repository: that can require replacement.
Check the preview for unexpected creation, replacement, deletion, or renaming before every deployment.

## Add another owner

Keep all owner definitions in `infra/github/`.
For example, you can add `totto2727-dotfiles` or `totto2727-archives` without a separate infrastructure directory.
Do not add token definitions for an owner until the App is installed there.

1. Install the App in the additional organization and grant access to its managed repositories.
2. Add a separate token entry under `values.tokens`. For example:

   ```yaml
   totto2727Dotfiles:
     fn::open::gh-login:
       appId: ${githubApp.appId}
       privateKey: ${githubApp.privateKey}
       owner: totto2727-dotfiles
       permissions:
         administration: write
         contents: write
         metadata: read
   ```

3. Add the corresponding entry under `values.pulumiConfig`:

   ```yaml
   githubOwners:totto2727DotfilesToken: ${tokens.totto2727Dotfiles.accessToken}
   ```

4. Create an owner-specific module with a factory and individual repository definitions:

   ```ts
   import * as pulumi from '@pulumi/pulumi'

   import { createRepositoryFactory } from './repository.ts'

   const createRepository = createRepositoryFactory(
     'totto2727-dotfiles',
     new pulumi.Config('githubOwners').requireSecret('totto2727DotfilesToken'),
   )

   export const example = createRepository('example')
   ```

   Define the repositories and their required settings.
   Import existing repositories before deployment, or let Pulumi create new ones.
   Import the module in `index.ts` and include its resources in the stack outputs.
   For `totto2727-archives`, use owner `totto2727-archives`, token entry `totto2727Archives`, and config key `githubOwners:totto2727ArchivesToken`.

Each factory binds its resources to an owner-specific Provider and includes the owner in Pulumi resource names.
Tokens are separate for each installation.
However, a shared App private key can issue tokens for all of that App's installations.
If private keys must also be separate, create one App per owner and use its credentials in the corresponding ESC token entry.
The Provider structure does not need to change.

## Adopt `totto2727-dotfiles/nix`

The only managed repository for `totto2727-dotfiles` is [`nix`](https://github.com/totto2727-dotfiles/nix), declared in [`src/totto2727-dotfiles.ts`](./src/totto2727-dotfiles.ts).
It is an existing public, non-fork, non-template repository with Issues enabled and an empty description and homepage.
The declaration preserves those values and applies the shared repository policy.
This follow-up is stacked on monorepo PR #397 and must retain that implementation as its base.

Before preview or deployment, confirm that the GitHub App is installed for `totto2727-dotfiles` with access to `nix` and that ESC provides `githubOwners:totto2727DotfilesToken` as described above.
Do not substitute another owner's installation token.
This change does not create or modify App installations, ESC secrets, or remote Pulumi state.

Before any managed apply, separately authorize and import the existing repository into the `production` stack with logical name `repository-totto2727-dotfiles-nix`, import ID `nix`, and the `totto2727-dotfiles` Provider.
Do not run an unscoped import with another owner's credentials.
Inspect existing remote rulesets and vulnerability-alert state before adoption and import matching resources if they already exist.
The 2026-11-08 read-only inspection returned no repository rulesets and confirmed vulnerability alerts are already enabled.
Adopt that existing alert setting as `vulnerability-alerts-totto2727-dotfiles-nix` rather than treating it as a newly enabled feature.
Preserve all existing protection rules and verify that preview proposes no repository creation, replacement, deletion, visibility change, or renaming.
Import and apply are separate operations that require explicit authorization.

No status check is required initially.
As checked on 2026-11-08, [`nix` PR #1](https://github.com/totto2727-dotfiles/nix/pull/1) is open, `main` has no workflow directory, and that PR defines a `check` job triggered only by `push`.
Merging PR #1 alone is not sufficient to make `check` a safe required PR check, especially for fork contributions.
Enable PR-triggered validation first, verify that `check` reports on representative pull requests, then change the declaration's third argument to `['check']` in a separate reviewed change.
If merge queues are enabled later, verify `merge_group` coverage before requiring the check for queued merges.

## Checks

```bash
vp check infra/github
vp test run --dir infra/github
```
